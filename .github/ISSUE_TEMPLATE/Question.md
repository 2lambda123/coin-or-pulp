Thanks for coming here to ask a question. :)

Before asking your question, please make sure you have:

1. Visited the pulp's google group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pulp-or-discuss). There, you can look for past questions and ask new ones. That's the official way of asking for help.
2. Searched for an existing similar question in the project Issues.

In case you tried and failed to get help in the google group and did not find any relevant previous issue, please write your question here and put a link to your original question on the google group.
